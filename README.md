Hello my name is Harshvardhan singh bais and below is the basic overview of the challenges and decisions I had to face or take while working on this project.

During the design process, I looked at various designs on google to get a general idea of the structure of my website.I chose the theme of the website from colorhunt.io which provides a large varity of themes and to manage time for design and implementing code I kept the design minimal and simple. Figma design was not very difficult.
The challenge was to transform the design into React.js. Although there are some differences between the design and code, the end result is still similar.
The first step was to figure out where to start. I sketched a basic chart on a piece of paper using only a pen.Then, I started building the components systematically. I started with the Home page and worked my way up to the cart pages. I added images from unsplash and searched a lot for a good API to integrate.I was able to complete the task, but there is still some work to be done. I am determined to fix the issue with adding the items to the cart.

Finding the right API and dealing with the lack of data within it became a problem. Adding this data as component props with the api's data together was little tricky.
Problems with cart functionality were mainly due to issues with the API and the prop integration as the data was according to not able to reach at the destination i wanted it to reach. The problem was not solved.
The CSS aspect wasnâ€™t too difficult, but it did present a complexity, especially due to the length of the CSS and the number of components.
One of the most difficult parts of the project was implementing effective product filtering. To solve this, you had to use browser tools. The website was crashing again and again I had to check console each time for different errors but at the end it all worked fine.

There was one more challenge infront of me, After deploying the app on github the herosection image and company logo disappeared and while I was trying to resolve it I did some unnecessary changes and ultimately had to delete and create a new repository and couldn't deploy it on github but I it can be downloaded and run locally in the system.
